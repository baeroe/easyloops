# easyloops

easyloops is an online loop-machine. It allows you to create music like a one-man-band.

You can create any amount of tracks and on each track you can record any amount of layers. Test the boundaries ;)
Thanks to the integrated metronom, the recording process starts on the beginning on the next tact. Just setup the BPM before you start the loop.
You can mondify the audio signals on each track with an integrated EQ.
