# easyloops

easyloops is an online loop-machine. It allows you to create music like a one-man-band.

You can create any amount of tracks and on each track you can record any amount of layers. Test the boundaries ;)
Thanks to the integrated metronome, the recording process starts on the beginning of the next tact. Just set up the BPM before you start the loop.
You can modify the audio signals on each track with an integrated EQ.

To build and run the app locally download the repository and run the following commands in the project folder:

    npm install
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    npm run start
    
Be sure that you have nodejs and npm installed!
    
Be aware that the login and save function does not work, bc there is no connection to a server. The website has only been tested on chrome and Firefox.
It is possible that there are some UI Bugs. If some Elements are out of bounds, decrease the zoom level of your browser.
    
good luck and have fun!
